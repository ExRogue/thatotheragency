        <p>
          For many London service businesses, lead costs rise because acquisition,
          landing-page messaging, and qualification steps are not aligned. The
          result is more spend, lower lead quality, and slower sales velocity.
        </p>

        <aside class="insight-box">
          <strong>Key point:</strong>
          Better lead economics usually come from offer/message alignment before
          additional media spend.
        </aside>

        <h2>1. Split campaigns by buying intent</h2>
        <p>
          Keep high-intent audiences separate from exploratory traffic. If both
          are mixed in one campaign structure, optimisation signals are diluted
          and budget decisions become unreliable.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Build offer-specific landing pages</h2>
        <p>
          Paid traffic should land on tightly focused pages that match ad intent,
          not generic homepages. Use one message hierarchy, one primary CTA, and
          trust signals relevant to that specific offer.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Improve qualification quality, not just form volume</h2>
        <p>
          Ask only for fields that improve sales-fit judgement: budget range,
          timeline, and core objective. Overly long forms reduce conversion, but
          overly short forms increase poor-fit leads.
        </p>

        <h2>4. Track SQL economics, not just CPL</h2>
        <p>
          CPL is useful, but cost per sales-qualified lead gives a clearer signal
          of true channel efficiency. Review SQL rate by campaign and landing
          page so media and conversion work can be prioritised correctly.
