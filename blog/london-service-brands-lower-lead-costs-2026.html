            <p>
              Cost per lead tends to rise when campaign structure, offer message, and page conversion path are not aligned.
              Teams often react by reducing spend, but that usually hides the root issue. A better route is to tighten the
              full demand path so qualified intent is protected at each stage.
            </p>

            <aside class="insight-box"><strong>Key point:</strong> Focus on cost per sales-qualified lead, not just top-line CPL.</aside>

            <h2 id="intent">1. Segment campaigns by buying intent</h2>
            <p>
              Keep high-intent traffic separate from discovery traffic. If these audiences are blended into one campaign,
              optimisation signals become noisy and budget shifts in the wrong direction.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Separate campaigns by service intent and urgency</li>
              <li>Use dedicated ad sets for high-intent keyword and audience groups</li>
              <li>Review lead quality at campaign level every week</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="offer">2. Match ad promise to landing-page message</h2>
            <p>
              If the ad frames one promise and the page opens with another, conversion rate drops and poor-fit leads rise.
              Build pages around one offer, one audience, and one primary action.
            </p>

            <h2 id="qualification">3. Improve qualification without overloading forms</h2>
            <p>
              Short forms increase volume but can reduce lead quality. Add only fields that support qualification decisions,
              such as budget, timeline, or core objective.
            </p>

            <h2 id="measurement">4. Measure SQL economics in weekly reviews</h2>
            <p>
              Include cost per sales-qualified lead, qualification rate, and close-rate signals by source. This helps you
              decide where to scale and where to fix conversion friction first.
            </p>

            <h2 id="implementation">Implementation checklist</h2>
            <ol>
              <li>Audit campaign segmentation and remove mixed-intent structures.</li>
              <li>Create service-specific landing experiences tied to ad message.</li>
              <li>Define a lead-quality rubric with your sales team.</li>
              <li>Run weekly reviews against SQL and opportunity quality, not CPL alone.</li>
            </ol>

            <h2 id="faq">Frequently asked questions</h2>
            <details>
              <summary>What is a healthy CPL benchmark in London?</summary>
              <p>There is no reliable universal benchmark. Track SQL cost and pipeline quality by channel before deciding if CPL is truly high.</p>
            </details>
            <details>
              <summary>Should we reduce spend immediately when CPL rises?</summary>
              <p>Not always. First diagnose intent targeting, offer clarity, and conversion friction. Spend cuts without diagnosis can remove good demand.</p>
            </details>
