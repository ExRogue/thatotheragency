        <p>
          Many paid social accounts stall because creative variables are tested
          without structure. A consistent testing programme improves signal
          quality and budget confidence.
        </p>

        <aside class="insight-box">
          <strong>Key point:</strong>
          Better testing discipline often outperforms higher production spend.
        </aside>

        <h2>Week-by-week testing rhythm</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Week 1: test three hooks against one offer and audience segment</li>
          <li>Week 2: scale winning hooks with new body-angle variants</li>
          <li>Week 3: test new formats (UGC, founder-led, demo-led)</li>
          <li>Week 4: consolidate winners and reallocate budget</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>What to measure</h2>
        <p>
          Review thumb-stop performance, hold rate, CTR, and post-click
          conversion quality. Creative should be judged by revenue behaviour, not
          only top-of-funnel engagement.
        </p>

        <h2>Common pitfall for DTC teams</h2>
        <p>
          Teams often over-index on polished edits and under-invest in angle
          diversity. In early cycles, message variation usually creates stronger
          learning than visual polish alone.

        <h2>Frequently asked questions</h2>
        <details>
          <summary>How many creatives should be tested each week?</summary>
          <p>
            It depends on spend and funnel volume, but consistency matters more than
            quantity. Weekly controlled tests outperform irregular large drops.
          </p>
        </details>
        <details>
          <summary>Should creative testing be separated by audience?</summary>
          <p>
            Yes. Keep audience context stable where possible so you can isolate
            creative signal quality without blending too many variables.
